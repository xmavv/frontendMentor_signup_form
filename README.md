## Welcome ðŸ˜Ž

### Deploying_project

- Here is live server ==> https://xmavv-introcomponent.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS form validation

### What I learned

I learned how to do good (no live yet) form valitadion in js, including css properties, such as border and text color in case of the error or success

How to write semantic HTML, and how to style its components inside CSS

A bit responsive design, different styles, font-sizes, flexbox on smartphone screen

### What I added

Also I added an success (tic) icon, when input inside form is correctly filled, there wasn't such one default, feel free to use it (remember to add background-size: 24px; cause my svg isn't that good, this would fix it)
